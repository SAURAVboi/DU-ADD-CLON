# DU-ADD-CLON
This project is a fun clone of Delhi University's CSAS portal, mimicking its look but not replicating the original functionality. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it serves as a front-end representation with design similarities to the official site while being purely for learning and exploration purposes.
